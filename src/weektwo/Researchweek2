	Loops are basically control statements and provide a way to maneuver the flow of the program. 
	Java has three repetition statements
	
	A for loop is a control structure that allows us to repeat certain operations by incrementing
	 and evaluating a loop counter.
	 there is a chance that the loop may not execute at all if the condition is false.
	 The for loop is used to repeat a section of code known number of times. 
	 Sometimes it is the computer that knows how many times, not you, but it is still known. 
	 

	Unknown number of times:

 	"Ask the User to Guess a pre-determined number between 1 and 100".
	 You have no way of knowing how many guesses it will take.

	"Randomly look in an array for a given value." You have no way of 
	knowing how many tries it will take to find the actual value.

  	Known number of times:

	Compute the average grade of the class. 
	While you (the programmer) might not know how many grades exist in the class, 
	the computer will know. Usually this is accomplished by using the "length" function on an array.

	Print the odd numbers from 1 to 1001.

	Search a list (array) of numbers for the biggest grade. Again, the computer 
	"knows" how many grades there are, so a for loop is appropriate.
	 		
	 		
	while loop: A "While" Loop is used to repeat a specific block of code an unknown number of times,
	 until a condition is met.For example, if we want to ask a user for a number between 1 and 10, 
	 we don't know how many times the user may enter a larger number, so we keep asking "while the 
	 number is not between 1 and 10". If we (or the computer) knows exactly how many
	 times to execute a section of code (such as shuffling a deck of cards) we use a for loop.
	
	do while: do while loop is similar to while loop with only difference that it checks for 
	condition after executing the statements,
	and therefore is an example of Exit Control Loop. It is a loop with the test at the bottom, 
	rather than the more usual test at the top.
	It is useful when you want to execute the body of the loop at least once without evaluating 
	its condition. For example, lets say you want to write a loop where you are prompting the user
	for input and depending on input execute some code. You would want this to execute at least once 
	and then ask the user whether he wants continue.
	In such cases, do..while loop results in lesser and cleaner code compared to a while loop.
